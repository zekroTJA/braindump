Vercel is primarily a Serverless Cloud provider for Next.JS and Node.JS applications, but you can even host serverless functions in compiled languages like Go (using their [Go SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/go)) or Rust (using the Community [Rust SDK](https://github.com/vercel-community/rust)).

Serverless of course has some disadvantages compared to root servers or VPS, but generally Vercel offers a really generous free tier. So small applications suitable for serverless can be hosted basically for free there. You can also schedule jobs using [Cron Tasks](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs), but in the free tier, you can only use a minimum interval of 24 hours.
