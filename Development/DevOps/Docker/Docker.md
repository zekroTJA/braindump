# What is this?

> **Docker** is a set of [platform as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) products that use [OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization) to deliver software in packages called _[containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(virtualization))_.[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)#cite_note-SYS-CON_Media-5) The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called **Docker Engine**. It was first started in 2013 and is developed by [Docker, Inc]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker,_Inc.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker,_Inc.)).
