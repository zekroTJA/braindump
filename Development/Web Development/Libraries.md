Some general purpose libraries for web development I really like to use.

# [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next)

Simple and easy to use internationalization (i18n) library which also comes with a lot of handy wrappers, i.e. for React.

[React](https://www.notion.so/React-f7bcd69d5607440794528b9167464806?pvs=21)

There are some additional plugins around this library as well.

- [https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector) Automatically detects the users language via the Browser preferences.
- [https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend) Uses an HTTP API to fetch the translation definitions.

# [color](https://github.com/Qix-/color)

A very handy library to mix, convert and apply effects on colors. I really like to use this in combination with `styled-components`.

# [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)

A really versatile and small library for date and time management, calculation and formatting. A great and light weight alternative to [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

# [debounce](https://github.com/component/debounce)

This can be used to delay actions — for example API calls — after user inputs.

Because I am always finding myself searching for this library because I forget the term `debounce`, following some keywords so I hopefully might find it here.
