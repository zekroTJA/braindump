# Learning Resources

## Go Tour

One of the easiest resources to get started with Go quick is the Go Tour. It contains concise information about almost all language features and quirks of the language in a slide-show styled web application with a lot of useful examples.

## Go Source Code

If you are already a bit deeper into the language, I think the code of the standard library is the best source for learning how to work with the language by just looking at how the Go team does achieve certain things. Also, the standard library is pretty well understandable and has some great documentation.
