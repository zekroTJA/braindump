From the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten):
> A **_Zettelkasten_** ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): 'slipbox', plural **_Zettelkästen_**) or **card file** consists of small items of information stored on _Zetteln_ (German: 'slips'), paper slips or cards, that may be linked to each other through [subject headings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term "Index term") or other [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") such as numbers and [tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_\(metadata\) "Tag (metadata)").[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#cite_note-1)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#cite_note-Eco-2) It has often been used as a system of [note-taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking "Note-taking") and [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) for research, study, and writing.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#cite_note-3)

The Zettelkasten system is used to store dieas and concepts on individual note pieces which can be ordered into categories and which can have metadata attached. Also, a core part of the concept is the linkage between notes so that a greater net of concepts and connections arises from the collection of notes.
