I’ve used and tested _a lot_ of note taking, scribbling, visualization and progress tracking tools in the past and so I want to compile my findings about them here.

# My current Stack

These are the main tools I currently stuck with using and which fit my needs the best — at least at the moment.

## [Notion](notion.so/)

Notion is a very versatile and flexible tool to take notes, lists, collect information and collaborate with others and thus has become my main tool for gathering information, keeping track of stuff I do, dump ideas or organizing stuff.
