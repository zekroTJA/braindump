> I am using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage this vault. Though you should be able to navigate and work with this collection of notes in any other app, some syntax like `[[Backlinks]]` will only work inside Obsidian.
# Braindump 🧠

In 2022, I set myself a goal to document everything around what I learn, what I work with or what I am discovering in a public repository of knowledge, because you will most likely not be able to recall everything you've learned, but so you can look it up at any time.

Quick disclaimer: This repository does not contain fully self contained documentation though because I just want to quickly capture the important stuff as concise and quick as possible so that I can work from that to recall the topic or to get back in more easily.

# Contribution

Feel free to create an issue if you have any idea on how to improve these docs or if you want to add missing information. You are also free to create pull-requests, if you find a mistake or want to add something to a topic. but keep in mind that the request might be declined when I think that it does not fit in my notes.
